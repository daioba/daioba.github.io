I am a researcher at <a href="https://www.nlp.c.titech.ac.jp/index.en.html">the Okazaki Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://www.isct.ac.jp/en">Institute of Science Tokyo</a> under Prof. Naoaki Okazaki. 
I'm interested in NLP, large language models, AI safety, and interpretability â€” aiming for a society where humans and machines coexist through language.
