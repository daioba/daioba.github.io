I am working on natural language processing and machine learning
advised by [Prof. Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html), 
with a strong interest in generative models such as diffusion language models [\[ICLR2026\]](https://daioba.github.io/surelock/) [\[arXiv2026\]](https://daioba.github.io/dispo/) and in test-time scaling of LLMs [\[ICLR2026\]](https://jkomiyama.github.io/bestofinfty/) [\[arXiv2026\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09574).

Previously: I led an ML team as a Lead AI Engineer at [ELYZA Inc](elyza.ai), developing japanese large language models such as [Llama-3-ELYZA-JP-8B](https://huggingface.co/elyza/Llama-3-ELYZA-JP-8B).
I received my PhD in March 2023 at [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), advised by [Prof. Masashi Toyoda](https://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~toyoda/index_e.html) and [Prof. Naoki Yoshinaga](https://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ynaga/index.en.html). Since my visiting to [the University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) during my PhD, I have been collaborating with [Prof. Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/publication.en.html).
